This project is started to follow [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) as a learning project. This was one of the final tasks to finish learning JavaScript before learning frameworks.

Things that I plan on implement:

- color picker
- shading
- save file option
- showing a grid as ruler
- responsive, for small screens, small grid and options in hamburger menu

- onhover effects
- show position (x:0, y:0, hex:#fff)



And some ideas to improve:

- colorpicker to take from canvas
- automatic shape creator
